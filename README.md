## Task 0

a) Create a GitHub repository. Create a readme.md file and write about yourselves. You can show your creativity here.
b) Make a commit and push your changes.
c) Now, create a new branch from the current commit and add a new file named sorting.cpp and write your favourite sorting algorithm in that file and push it to your newly created branch.
d) Again branch-out from the current branch and add a commented line at the start of the file which should contain your first-name and your roll number. Now commit the changes and push to your new branch. Eg: //Rohith 106115070
e) Now, come back to the previous branch where the sorting.cpp file was created and add a commented line containing your last-name and your roll number and commit it. Eg: //Balaji 106115070
f) Merge the new branch with the current branch. You will be having some merge conflicts :p. Fix the conflicts and create a new commit.
g) Now merge the current branch with the master branch. Add a tag named “Final” to the last commit and push your code.
